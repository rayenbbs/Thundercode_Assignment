### **Key Metrics**  
| Element                        | Status              | Notes                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Color Contrast**             | Fails (Critical)    | Insufficient contrast (e.g., `#a80f21` on `#05012a`).                                     |
| **Image Alt Attributes**       | Pass                | All images include meaningful alt attributes.                                             |
| **Touch Target Sizing**        | Pass                | Buttons and touchable areas are adequately sized.                                         |
| **ARIA Roles & Labels**        | Pass                | Compliant with correct usage of labels for interactive and dynamic elements.              |
| **Language Tag**               | Pass                | Proper `<html lang="fr">` declaration provided.                                           |

### **Improvement Areas**  
1. **Contrast Adjustments**:  
   - **Issue**: Some elements lack sufficient foreground/background contrast.  
   - **Example**: Menu links (e.g., "Accueil") appear dull due to `#a80f21` text color on `#05012a` background.  
   - **Recommendation**: Redesign the color palette to meet at least a **contrast ratio of 4.5:1** for standard text.  

2. **Skip Navigation Links**:  
   - **Issue**: No skip navigation link present.  
   - **Recommendation**: Add skip links as the first focusable element to let keyboard users bypass repetitive elements.  

3. **Focus Indicators**:  
   - **Observation**: Need proper customization of focus styles for better visibility during keyboard navigation.  
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure visible focus styles meet WCAG minimum requirements for interactivity.

4. **Dynamic Content Management**:  
   - **Issue**: Focus traps and logical tab order were not manually validated.  
   - **Recommendation**: Conduct manual accessibility tests for elements dynamically added via JS to ensure logical tabbing.  

---

### **Recommendations Summary**  
- Prioritize fixing contrast ratio failures across layout elements.  
- Introduce skip navigation features for better accessibility.  
- Test tab order and visually verify focus states align with design expectations.
