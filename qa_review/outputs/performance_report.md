## Opportunities for Optimization  
1. **Avoid Serving Legacy JavaScript:**  
   - Some legacy JavaScript is being served, which is unnecessary for modern browsers.  
   - **Details:** A small potential saving of 65 bytes was detected. Consider removing polyfills or outdated transforms.  

   **Actionable Suggestion:** Use modern script deployment strategies (e.g., `module`/`nomodule` feature detection) to minimize unnecessary payload. [Guide on Modern JavaScript Deployment](https://web.dev/publish-modern-javascript/).  

2. **Better Lazy Loading for Above-the-Fold Images:**  
   - Identified that the Largest Contentful Paint images are not lazy-loaded, which can degrade performance for above-the-fold content.  
   
   **Actionable Suggestion:** Ensure critical images, especially above the fold, are loaded without applying lazy-loading attributes.  

3. **Layout Shifts:**  
   - A few layout shifts were observed; web fonts and CSS resources adjusted layouts during load. Specific elements causing shifts include headings and primary content areas.  

   **Actionable Suggestion:** Preload web fonts and optimize CSS to reduce layout shifts. Prioritize a font-display strategy such as `font-display: swap`.

## Diagnostics and Insights

## Conclusion  
Website performance metrics for "https://www.jeinsat.com/" are excellent, with a **Performance Score of 97/100**, and loading times well within optimal ranges: FCP at 0.8s and LCP at 0.9s. However, optimization opportunities such as addressing legacy JavaScript, improving lazy loading strategy for LCP elements, and reducing layout shifts will further enhance the website's performance and user experience.  

By addressing these suggestions, the website can target an even higher experience standard for users.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Preload critical above-the-fold content.  
2. Update JavaScript to modern standards.  
3. Optimize layout stability by addressing late-loading resources.
