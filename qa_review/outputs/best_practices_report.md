# Best-Practices Compliance Report for https://www.jeinsat.com/  

## Compliance Score  
The website scores moderately on web development best practices, with evident potential for improvement in key areas. Some critical issues, such as HTTPS implementation and resolving mixed content warnings, need urgent attention.  

---

## Key Metrics and Their Values  

- **Secure Connection (HTTPS)**:  
  - **Status**: Not compliant.  
  - **Issues Found**: Two insecure requests were identified.  
    - http://20.19.80.208:5000/footer-info  
    - http://20.19.80.208:5000/partner  
  - **Description**: HTTPS implementation is flawed with mixed content warnings due to resources being served over HTTP.  

- **Error Logs in Console**:   
  - **Status**: Non-compliant.  
  - Issues logged due to mixed content and minor code errors.  
  - Examples:  
    - **Mixed Content**: The page at "https://www.jeinsat.com/" requested insecure endpoints.  
    - **JavaScript Error**: Y flagged in the console.  

- **Requests for Permissions**:  
  - **Geolocation Permission**: Not requested on page load (Good).  
  - **Notification Permission**: Handled responsibly and not bothering users unnecessarily.  

- **Browser Features**:  
  - Character encoding properly defined (Good).  
  - Responsive images serve correct sizes and display proper aspect ratios.  

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:  
  - **Status**: CSP not found in enforced mode, leaving the site vulnerable to XSS attacks.  

- **User Experience**:  
  - Font sizes are likely legible, optimized for mobile use (Compliance not applicable on this run).  
  - Viewport meta tag correctly implemented for mobile responsiveness.  

- **Source Maps for Debugging**:  
  - Valid source maps are available for better debugging during production.

## Opportunities for Improvement  

1. **Enable Full HTTPS Compliance**:  
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and fix mixed content issues.  
   - Ensure all internal and external resources (e.g., images, APIs) are served over HTTPS.  
   
2. **Improve Console Error Handling**:  
   - Investigate and fix logged errors to ensure smooth operation across browsers.  

3. **Implement and Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP)**:  
   - Add and enforce a robust CSP to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  

4. **Enhance Security Features**:  
   - Ensure all endpoints and API calls utilize HTTPS to enhance user trust and security.  

5. **Optimize Assets**:  
   - Review server calls for any blocked resources to improve overall performance and accessibility.  

6. **Test Error Logs During Development**:  
   - Look into the small JavaScript errors logged (e.g., `"Y"` flagged) to clean up codebase maintainability.  

---

## Diagnosed Issues  

1. **Mixed Content Warnings**: HTTPS site loading HTTP resources.  
2. **Console Errors**: Mixed content-related issues and JavaScript errors.  
3. **Lack of Content Security Policy**: Increases risks of vulnerability.  
4. **Best Practices Impact Limited by Inactive Diagnostics on Font Sizes**: Requires finer tuning for UX.

## Suggestions for Improvement  

- Perform a full audit of the HTTP requests being made and update all resources (especially those pointing to `http://20.19.80.208...`) to HTTPS.  
- Apply a strong Content Security Policy to prevent malicious scripts.  
- Regularly monitor and debug the console for errors, ensuring these are resolved during development.  
- Conduct a UX audit for font sizes, legibility, and user flow.  
- Enhance the websiteâ€™s Lighthouse audit score by maintaining all aspects of modern web standards, including SEO, accessibility, and PWA performance indicators.  

By addressing these areas, the website can achieve greater adherence to modern web development standards, strengthen user trust, and improve its overall performance.
