# Best-Practices Compliance Report for **https://www.jeinsat.com/**  

## Compliance Score  
**Overall Compliance Score:** Unable to provide specific aggregated score, but below you will find itemized assessments of key metrics and areas for improvement.  

---

## Key Metrics and Values  

- **HTTPS Usage:**  
  - **Status:** Does not meet security best practices.  
  - **Issue:** The site serves some insecure resources, resulting in **"mixed content"** warnings.  
  - **Details:**  
    - `http://20.19.80.208:5000/footer-info` (Blocked)  
    - `http://20.19.80.208:5000/partner` (Blocked)  

- **Character Encoding (Charset):**  
  - **Status:** The page properly defines the charset.  

- **Image Optimization:**  
  - **Aspect Ratio Compliance:** Images are displayed with the correct aspect ratio.  
  - **Resolution Compliance:** Responsive images are served with appropriate resolution for display requirements.  

- **Meta Viewport:**  
  - **Status:** Configured for mobile performance.  
  - **Details:** Meta viewport tag is present with content `width=device-width, initial-scale=1`.  

- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  
  - **Status:** No CSP found in enforcement mode, which may leave the site vulnerable to XSS attacks.  

- **Browser Console Errors:**  
  - **Status:** Encountered errors.  
  - **Details:**  
    - **Type:** Mixed Content  
      - A secure page requests resources over an insecure connection (`http://`).  

- **JavaScript Libraries:** Not applicable for assessment in this context.

## Opportunities for Improvement & Violations  

### 1. **Address Mixed Content Issues:**  
   - Secure all resources (e.g., `http://20.19.80.208:5000`) to use HTTPS. Mixed content will break HTTPS integrity and potentially expose sensitive information.  
   - [Googleâ€™s Guidance on Mixed Content](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content).  

### 2. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  
   - Enforce a strong CSP to mitigate risks of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  
   - [Learn more on how to create and enforce a CSP](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/csp-xss/).  

### 3. **Fix Browser Console Errors:**  
   - Ensure all third-party scripts or resources are up-to-date and securely loaded (HTTPS).

## Diagnostics  
1. Mixed content issues resulted in resource blocking:  
   - May affect the page rendering and response.  
2. Lack of CSP enforcement is a high-security risk.

## Suggestions for Improving Compliance  

1. **Migrate All Resources to HTTPS:**  
   - Ensure every asset is loaded through a secure HTTPS connection to guarantee encryption and prevent mixed content.  

2. **Enforce a Strict CSP:**  
   - Write and implement a Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load content.  

3. **Use a DevTools Audit Tool:**  
   - Regularly run performance and best-practices audits in the Chrome DevTools "Lighthouse" panel to catch issues early on.  

4. **Fix JavaScript Console Errors:**  
   - Debug scripts to reduce potential bottlenecks in resource loading or security issues from mixed requests.  

5. **Optimize Resource Handling:**  
   - Review unnecessary or malformed requests and eliminate any redundant legacy references.
