## Opportunities for SEO Improvement:  

1. **Add a Meta Description:**  
   - Craft a concise, keyword-rich meta description for each page. Aim for approximately **150-160 characters**, clearly summarizing content.  

2. **Structured Data Enhancement:**  
   - Use schema.org structured data formats like LocalBusiness, Website, or AboutPage to mark up critical information.  
   - Actionable Tool: Google Structured Data Testing Tool / Linter tools.  

3. **Canonicalization:**  
   - Review URLs and implement rel=canonical tags where applicable to prevent indexing duplicate versions of content.  

4. **Page Load Speed Optimization (Mobile)**
