### Key Metrics & Their Values
1. **Contrast Ratio**:
   - Potential Issues: Dynamic websites often suffer from inadequate color contrast between text and backgrounds, affecting users with visual impairments.
   - Suggestion: Ensure all text meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards, with a contrast ratio of at least:
     - 4.5:1 for normal text.
     - 3:1 for large text.

2. **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Usage**:
   - Potential Issues: ARIA landmarks may not be properly implemented, resulting in navigation challenges for screen reader users.
   - Suggestion: Test ARIA roles to ensure they are used appropriately, e.g., ensuring all menus and modals are labeled with meaningful descriptions.

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Potential Issues: Interactive elements could be inaccessible via keyboard, adversely impacting users relying on keyboard-only navigation.
   - Suggestion: Check for focus indicators and ensure tab order is logical and intuitive.

4. **Screen Reader Compatibility**:
   - Potential Issues: Custom components like dropdowns or forms may lack proper labeling, hindering compatibility with assistive technologies.
   - Suggestion: Use labels, alt attributes, and ARIA properties to provide meaningful context.

### Opportunities to Improve Accessibility
1. **Responsive Design**:
   - Verify the website adapts seamlessly across devices and screen sizes, including tools like screen magnifiers.

2. **Language Attributes**:
   - Ensure the page includes a language declaration `<html lang="en">` to assist screen readers in detecting content language.

3. **Error Feedback**:
   - Check for clear, accessible error messages in forms to guide users effectively.

4. **Alt Text for Images**:
   - Assign alternative text (`alt`) descriptions to all graphical elements to support visually impaired users.

5. **Video/Audio Content**:
   - Ensure all media content includes captions and transcripts to assist users with hearing impairments.

### Suggested Improvements for Inclusivity
1. **Conduct WCAG Testing**:
   - Perform a full audit using tools like screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, and site-specific contrast tests.
   
2. **Accessibility Training**:
   - Offer developers formal training in inclusive design principles to continually enhance website usability.

3. **Browser Testing**:
   - Validate performance across multiple browsers, especially those used heavily with assistive tech, such as NVDA or JAWS.

4. **User Feedback**:
   - Regularly engage with real users with disabilities to identify barriers that automated tools might miss.

By addressing these areas, Facebook can ensure a more inclusive, legally-compliant, and user-friendly experience for all individuals.
