## **Performance Report**  

### **Performance Score**  
- **Score:** 97/100  

#### **Key Metrics**  
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** 0.8 seconds  
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** 0.9 seconds  
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** 1.0 seconds  
- **Speed Index:** 1.0 seconds  
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** 0.0088 (Excellent)  

#### **Opportunities for Optimization**  
1. **Avoid Serving Legacy JavaScript**  
   - **Issue:** Small potential savings of 65 bytes detected with unnecessary polyfills or outdated transforms.  
   - **Recommendation:** Use modern script deployment strategies, leveraging `module`/`nomodule` detection to eliminate legacy JavaScript.  
   - **Reference:** [Guide on Modern JavaScript Deployment](https://web.dev/publish-modern-javascript/).  

2. **Improve Lazy Loading for Above-the-Fold Images**  
   - **Issue:** Critical images for Largest Contentful Paint are not optimized for lazy loading.  
   - **Recommendation:** Exclude above-the-fold images from lazy-loading logic to prevent rendering delays.  

3. **Reduce Layout Shifts**  
   - **Issue:** Web fonts and CSS resources cause minor layout shifts, especially for headings and primary content.  
   - **Recommendation:** Employ a `font-display: swap` strategy and preload critical CSS.  

#### **Diagnostics**  
- **Resource Usage:**  
   - Total number of requests: **61**  
   - Total transferred size: **1.1 MB**  
   - JavaScript: 37 requests (418 KB).  

- **Server-Response Time:** Excellent — 90ms initial response.  
- **JavaScript Execution:** Page parsing/execution: **0.7 seconds**.  

#### **Actionable Recommendations Summary**  
- Preload above-the-fold content.  
- Minimize legacy JavaScript usage.  
- Reduce layout shifts by optimizing font and CSS handling.  

**Conclusion:** The performance metrics are excellent, but addressing small inefficiencies in JavaScript, image loading logic, and layout rendering can optimize the site further.

## **Accessibility Report**  

### **Accessibility Score**  
- **Score Estimate:** Moderate compliance (<85%).   

#### **Key Findings**  
1. **Meta Viewport Tag:** No restrictions on zooming; this aids users with low vision. ✅  
2. **Focus Management:** Logical tab navigation observed; no focus traps found. ✅  
3. **ARIA Roles:** Correct, improving screen reader functionality. ✅  
4. **Color Contrast Issues:**  
   - Example: Red text (#a80f21) on dark blue background (#05012a) fails the WCAG-recommended 4.5:1 ratio.  

5. **Image Descriptions:** All images include descriptive `[alt]` attributes. ✅  
6. **HTML Language Attribute:** Present and valid. ✅  
7. **Touch Targets:** Big and spaced adequately for mobile users. ✅   

#### **Opportunities for Optimization**  
1. **Address Color Contrast**  
   - Adjust failing color combinations to meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines (minimum 4.5:1 for body text).  
2. **Add Skip Links**  
   - Introduce ‘skip to main content’ functionality for keyboard-only users.  
3. **Ensure Logical Tab Navigation**  
   - Conduct a manual review to confirm usability in all scenarios.  

#### **Actionable Recommendations Summary**  
- Expand accessibility features by improving color contrast and adding navigation aids.  
- Perform manual ARIA and keyboard testing for conformance with WCAG 2.1 AA.  

**Conclusion:** The website demonstrates an overall dedication to accessibility but requires proactive adjustments in contrast, navigation, and manual reviews to meet higher standards.

## **Best Practices Report**  

### **Best Practices Score**  
- Moderate compliance. Identified deficiencies impact user trust and development standards.  

#### **Key Findings and Issues**  
1. **Mixed Content Warnings (HTTPS):** Two insecure endpoints (`http://20.19.80.208:5000/...`) detected.  
2. **Missing Content Security Policy (CSP):** No security header to mitigate attacks such as XSS.  
3. **Console Errors:** Mixed content-related warnings and JavaScript errors found in the browser console.  

#### **Actionable Recommendations Summary**  
1. Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS; update API and resource links to HTTPS.  
2. Implement and enforce a robust CSP header.  
3. Monitor console logs, ensuring no errors persist from third-party or inline scripts.  

**Conclusion:** Addressing mixed content issues and proactive security header implementation will significantly improve compliance.

## **SEO Report**  

### **SEO Score**  
- Estimated: **70/100**  

#### **Key Findings**  
1. **Missing Meta Descriptions:** No meta descriptions detected on key pages.  
2. **Structured Data:** Limited schema.org data; manual testing recommended for improvements.  
3. **Canonical Tags Absent:** Not implemented, leaving the website vulnerable to duplicate content issues.  

#### **Opportunities for Optimization**  
- Add concise, keyword-rich meta descriptions to all pages.  
- Leverage structured data to improve SERP (e.g., LocalBusiness markup).  
- Ensure canonical tags are placed to avoid URL duplication.  

**Conclusion:** Optimizing structured data and addressing meta description gaps can enhance visibility and improve rankings.

## **Security Report**  

#### **Key Security Issues**  
1. **Missing Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) Header:** Increases risk of MITM attacks.  
2. **Lack of CSP Header:** No restrictions on external scripts, heightening XSS risk.  
3. **Exposed `X-Powered-By` Header:** Reveals framework (Next.js) and server information (Nginx/1.18.0).  

#### **Actionable Recommendations Summary**  
1. Enable HSTS with:  
   ```
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
   ```  
2. Add a CSP header:  
   ```
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
   ```  
3. Obfuscate/remove the `X-Powered-By` header for security.  

**Conclusion:** These changes will improve site defense against common vulnerabilities.

## **HTML Analysis Report**  

### **Key Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Inline Styles:** Move inline CSS into a separate stylesheet for maintainability.  
2. **Broken Links:** Fix empty `<a>` tags or point them to valid URLs.  
3. **Missing Image Alt Attributes:** Review and add alt descriptions to all image elements.
